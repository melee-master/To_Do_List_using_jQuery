# To do list using jQuery

->Made use of bootstrap, HTML, CSS and javascript to create this small project.\
->All the buttons are dynamic in nature.\
->We won't need the add and reset buttons if the input field is empty.\
->And, we won't need sort and cleanup buttons if the list is empty.\
->jQuery has been used to append the input value in to the list and also to check wether it is empty or not.\
->I have also used font-awesome to get the respective icons.\
->Bootstrap has been used.\
